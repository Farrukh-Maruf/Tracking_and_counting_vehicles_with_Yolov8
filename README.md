# Tracking_and_counting_vehicles_with_Yolov8
This project aim is to track, identify what type of vehicles and count them entering and exiting from certain line.

I have successfully implemented an object counting system utilizing YOLOv8. The model has been trained specifically for vehicle detection, enabling accurate counting of vehicles in a given scene. The implementation involves training the YOLOv8 model on annotated datasets to achieve robust detection performance. This system serves the purpose of automating vehicle counting, contributing to efficient traffic monitoring and management.
