# Tracking_and_counting_vehicles_with_Yolov8
This project aims to track and identify what types of vehicles and count them entering and exiting from certain lines.

I have successfully implemented an object counting system utilizing YOLOv8. The model has been trained specifically for vehicle detection, enabling accurate counting of vehicles in a given scene. 
The implementation involves training the YOLOv8 model on annotated datasets for robust detection performance. 
This system serves the purpose of automating vehicle counting, contributing to efficient traffic monitoring and management.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive vehicle tracking and identification system. The system utilizes YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to perform real-time tracking and classification of vehicles. The key functionalities include monitoring the entry and exit of vehicles across a defined line, accurately identifying the type of each vehicle, and maintaining a count of vehicles for analytical purposes
